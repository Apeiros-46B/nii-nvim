nii-nvim is a very minimal nvim dotfiles focused on creating a functional editor with a minmal amount of plugins. nii-nvim also has the user in mind by being very extensible and documented.
#### **NOTE**: nii-nvim is currently under development, meaning that many things may not work as intended, or may not be implemented at all.

## Why nii-nvim?
There are many neovim configurations that exist (i.e. NvChad, Lunar Vim, etc.), however, amny of these configurations suffer from a host of problems.
 - Some confugurations like NvChad, have very abstracted and complex codebases.
 - Others rely on having as much overall functionality as possible, like LunarVim.

While none of this is in its own right is bad, there are some problems that arise from these choices:
 - Complex codbases lead to less freedom for end-user extensiblity and configuration
 - Users may not use half of what is made avalible to them simply because they don't need all of that functionality

 nii-nvim provides a solution to these problems by providing only the bare minimum of necissary code in order to make a functioning configuration.
The end goal of nii-nvim is to be use as a base config for users to extend and add upon, leading to a more unique editing experience.
Also the name is cute, and sounds small. 	(・3・)
