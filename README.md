nii-nvim is a very minimal nvim dotfiles focused on creating a functional editor with a minmal amount of plugins. nii-nvim also has the user in mind by being very extensible and documented.
#### **NOTE**: nii-nvim is currently under development, meaning that many things may not work as intended, or may not be implemented at all.

## Why nii-nvim?
There are many neovim configurations that exist (i.e. NvChad, Lunar Vim, etc.), however, amny of these configurations suffer from a host of problems.
 - Some configurations (like NvChad), have very abstracted and complex codebases.
 - Others rely on having as much overall functionality as possible (like LunarVim).

While none of this is bad, there are some problems that can arise from these choices:
 - Complex codebases lead to less freedom for end-user extensiblity and configuration, as there is more reliance on teh maintainer of said code.
 - Users may not use half of what is made avalible to them simply because they don't need all of that functionality, so all of it may not be necissary

nii-nvim provides a solution to these problems by providing only the bare minimum of necissary code in order to make a functioning configuration.
The end goal of nii-nvim is to be use as a base config for users to extend and add upon, leading to a more unique editing experience.

Also the name is cute. 	(・3・)

- neovim 5.0 or greater
- fzf
- git
- A Nerd Font

## Features
- Heavy focus on both in-source documentation and external documentation.
- Sane Keybinds for extra added functionality
- Small codebase for easy extensibility
- A handful of plugins to build off neovim's strengths
- Swag (and Minimalisim!!)
